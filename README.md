# Wireless and Mobile Networks Calculator ðŸ“¡

## Description
This project serves as a practical tool for computing various metrics crucial in the field of wireless and mobile networks. The application supports calculations for sampler and interleaver configurations, OFDM parameters, power transmission calculations, throughput computations, and cellular system design. Each calculation module integrates specific formulas and considerations unique to the field of telecommunications, making it an invaluable educational and professional tool.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Form Fields**: Depending on the selected calculation type, the application dynamically generates the necessary input fields, demonstrating advanced DOM manipulation.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Implements `async` and `await` for making asynchronous requests to the server for calculation processing, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
- **Flask Server**: Utilizes Flask for the backend to handle API requests and serve the application, illustrating how Python can be employed in server-side development.
- **Data Handling**: Temporarily stores input data on the server to process calculations, showcasing server-side data management.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side scripting to manage user interactions and dynamically update the UI.
- **Python Flask**: For server-side logic, handling API requests and responses.
